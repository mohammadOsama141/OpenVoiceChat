# OpenVoiceChat

OpenVoiceChat is an opensource library that allows you to have natural voice conversations with your LLM agent.

If you plan on making an LLM agent and want to have your users be able to
talk to it like a person (low latency, handles interruptions), this
library is for you

It aims to be the opensource, highly extensible and easy to use alternative to the proprietary solutions.
