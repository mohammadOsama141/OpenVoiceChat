# OpenVoiceChat Roadmap


OVC's mission is to be the goto opensource library for making
voice bots.

Some core values of OVC are: 
- Usability (Very easy to use)
- Extensibility (Very easy to extend)
- Competitive (Featureful)

OVC follows a simplicity first philosophy with regards to 
development. We believe in the [bitter lesson](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html),
the final solution to voice agents is an end to end learned general approach.
Models will improve over time, there should be no 
model specific code and porting a model should be very easy.
Hence, when models improve so does OVC.
