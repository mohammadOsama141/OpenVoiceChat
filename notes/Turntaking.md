# When to speak

Vapi ai and Retell both have an internal turn taking model 
that decides when the AI should speak.

This should be useful for training the model.
It is important to consider the license of the data tho.

**What would the features of the model be?**
- Time since last utterance.
- What was last said by the other person.
